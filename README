Fixing hogwash issue when plotting very large dataset. 

Used got the following error message:


```
[1] "Ancestral reconstruction complete: 2021-04-23 12:54:56"
[1] "Permutation test complete: 2021-04-23 14:39:56"

Error in do.call("cbind", lapply(x, "is.na")) :

Failed run details: 

622552 variants
992 samples
pheno = pheno_test
geno = geno_test
tree = tree_new
tree_type = "phylogram"
file_name = "hogwash_both"
dir = "."
perm = 10000
fdr = 0.15
bootstrap = 0.70
test= "both"

Successful run had 458409 variants (only difference). 

So why did larger run fail?

TODO:

* Generate random genotype matrix with 700,000 variants
* Generate random phenotype with 1,000 samples
* Run with stated settings and fix plotting.
