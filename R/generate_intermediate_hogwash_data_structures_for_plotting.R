# Goal: generate the data structures using hogwash that are necessary to do the plotting within hogwash.
# In particular, make genotype structures of different sizes (100, 10000, 100000, 700000)
# Want to see if the 100,000 version is successful but the 700,000 version fails as expected given user bug report.

# Inputs needed for plotting function
# To do this, need to be in hogwash project, run interactively through some code, then save objects in an RData file
